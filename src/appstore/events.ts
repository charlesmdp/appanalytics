/**
 * Reviews, compiled onto the same timeline as everything else a customer does.
 *
 * The alternative was a parallel notion of "review events" with its own storage,
 * its own delivery ledger and its own idea of what counts as new. Writing them
 * into `customer_events` instead means the Customers page renders them without
 * knowing they came from a different source, the Slack dispatcher announces them
 * under rules it already enforces, and a review sits in the merchant's history
 * between the trial they started and the plan they upgraded to — which is where
 * a review is actually worth reading.
 *
 * Three rules make that safe:
 *
 *   - **Ids are deterministic.** `customer_events` is dropped and rewritten on
 *     every sync, so the delivery ledger's at-most-once promise rests entirely
 *     on an id that survives the rebuild. An edit folds its content hash into
 *     the id, so a second rewrite is a second piece of news rather than one that
 *     the ledger has already seen.
 *
 *   - **A review with no customer still gets an event**, carrying `shop_id = ''`
 *     exactly as a shopless app event does. It cannot appear on anybody's
 *     timeline, but "somebody left you a one-star" is news whether or not we
 *     worked out who, and suppressing it until the match landed would be
 *     silence at the worst moment.
 *
 *   - **Removal is dated, not deleted.** `review_removed` is emitted from
 *     `removed_at`, and the review row it came from is still there in full.
 *
 * Run after `buildCustomerEvents`, which clears the table; this only inserts.
