/**
 * Raw feed -> clean customer lifecycle events (customer-events spec 3).
 *
 * The Partner API's app-events feed is not a lifecycle. The same merchant
 * action shows up as several low-level facts, an upgrade arrives as *cancel the
 * old charge, activate a new one*, and nothing at all fires when a trial ends.
 * This module compiles that stream into the events a customer timeline and a
 * churn number actually want.
 *
 * Four rules shape the implementation:
 *
 *   1. **One timeline per install, folded in time order.** An activation cannot
 *      be classified in isolation: whether it is a subscribe, a win-back, an
 *      upgrade or a downgrade depends on what the shop was paying a moment
 *      earlier. The events the feed never sends — a trial converting, a loss the
 *      merchant expressed by uninstalling — are merged into that same timeline
 *      *before* the fold rather than appended after it, so the running balance
 *      sees every movement in the order it happened.
 *
 *   2. **`subscriptions` is the authority on money and on churn.** The cancel
 *      trap — "a lone cancel is usually a plan change, not a loss" — is already
 *      solved once in `derive.ts`, weighing cancels against plan changes,
 *      uninstalls and settlement lag. Re-deriving it here with a second window
 *      is exactly how an event timeline and a churn chart start disagreeing
 *      about the same merchant, so this module consumes that verdict.
 *
 *   3. **`net_change` is gated where MRR is gated.** MRR counts a subscription
 *      from its first paid charge, not its activation — a trial is live but
 *      worth nothing. An activation that opens a trial therefore carries a zero
 *      delta, and the money arrives later on `trial_converted`.
 *
 *   4. **The ledger balances.** Summing `net_change` over an install
 *      reconstructs its MRR contribution. `test/customerEvents.test.ts` asserts
 *      this against the MRR report itself, so the two cannot drift apart
 *      silently.
 *
 * Rebuilt wholesale on every sync. Ids are deterministic, so a rebuild
 * converges on the same rows rather than accumulating duplicates.
