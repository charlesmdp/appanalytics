/**
 * The review read model.
 *
 * Read straight from `app_reviews` with no as-of reconstruction, because unlike
 * every other list in this project a review is not a state that has to be
 * rebuilt from events — it is a document that was published on a date, possibly
 * rewritten, possibly taken down, and all three facts are columns.
 *
 * What this layer does add is the customer join, and the way it presents an
 * unmatched review. A review with no shop is shown as unmatched rather than
 * dropped or quietly attributed, because the partner reading the page is the
 * only one who can recognise a store name that our matcher could not.
