/**
 * Fetching listing pages from the public App Store.
 *
 * Deliberately not part of `partner/`. That module speaks one authenticated
 * GraphQL endpoint with a documented throttle and a `THROTTLED` error code; this
 * one reads unauthenticated HTML from a different host with no contract at all,
 * and folding the two together would mean either module's failures being
 * described in the other's vocabulary.
 *
 * What we owe the host, since nothing here is rate-limited on their side and
 * a full sweep of a large listing is hundreds of requests:
 *
 *   - one request at a time, never concurrent
 *   - a floor on the gap between them, enforced here rather than by callers
 *   - a User-Agent that says what this is, so it is identifiable in their logs
 *   - `Retry-After` obeyed when offered
 *
 * `apps.shopify.com/robots.txt` excludes `/internal/`, `/services/`, `*q=*` and
 * the auth query params. Listing and review paths are not excluded, and the
 * pages are public and unauthenticated — but the politeness above is what makes
 * that fact stay true for everyone else too.
